I was born in Brentwood hospital and spent my early years in [[Bedford]], Ohio.

Around the age of 12, my father started a business in and moved the family to [[Middlefield]], Ohio.

I spent my teenage years enjoying life in Middlefield and heading back and forth to Cleveland on the weekends.

After not getting it at school, I joined the [[Coast Guard]].  I lived in California for a year and then headed back to Ohio.

Eventually, I had three kids with my wonderful wife and now live in Ann Arbor.
