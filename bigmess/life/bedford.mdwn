The house I remember first is on Columbus.  The house I remember most is on Nordham Drive.

I went to school at [[Ellenwood]] elementary.  Had I stayed I would have done 6th grade at [[Central]], junior high at [[Moody]], and high school at [[Bedford High School]].  It's where [Halle Berry](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000932/?ref_=nv_sr_1) went to school.

Bedord had a historic downtown area and lots of places to explore.  I had a lot of family in the area.  There were candy stores, swimming pools, brick roads, woods and many places to explore.  It was a great town for a pre-teen.
