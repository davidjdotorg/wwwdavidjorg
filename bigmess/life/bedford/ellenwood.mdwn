Ellenwood elementary was crazy.

I tied for first in a spelling bee.  I fucked up the word believe in another one. I had great teachers and, from what I understand, great potential.

Mrs. Thwing had horn-rimmed glasses.

Mrs. Danziger took a shot from a cap gun.

The word penis was in the dictionary as a finger-shaped object.  The word fart was gas from the anus.  I still smile.

I think I remember fifth grade the most.  Mrs. Danziger.  Paula Danziger.  I still remember her as a beautiful woman.  This was possibly my first teacher crush.  Nothing masturbatory.  Not yet.

But back to Ellenwood.  So many names of friends.  Polly Bowen, Lynn Craig, Laura Natalie, Greg Zimmerman, Bill Harwood, Robby Nunan, Beth Something...  The Clotzes, the twins next door.  I have a lot of stories to be written here.
