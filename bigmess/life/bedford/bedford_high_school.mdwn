I didn't go to Bedford High.  I got moved out before I could.  Looking back I am okay with that.  At the time I thought I would have liked staying in Bedford better.  Either way, it's nice now to have two towns that I grew up in.

I had a cousin that got punched in the nose as he walked out of a class.  Sucker punched at Bedford High.

Beyond that I don't know much about the school.  It was very big.  White people have told me that there was a lot of tension between the blacks and the whites.  White people in Aurora have told me that they left Bedford and moved to Aurora because of "the blacks."  Other white people have told me there was too much drug activity in Bedford, but I think that is probably covert racism.

I hate racism.
