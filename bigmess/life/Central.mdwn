I visited Central elementary because Ellenwood was closing and I was told that I would be going there.  I knew that I was moving to Middlefield so the visit was stupid.

Central felt like a foreign country.  Just because of the location being on the other side of Columbus road.  I just didn't go that direction much.

I remember playing little league on the Bedford Benches.  My grandfather came to see a game and told me that the reason I wasn't getting any hits was because I wasn't keeping my eye on the ball.  I decided to keep my eye on the ball and really give it my best shot.  

I distinctly remember striking out multiple times and each time I swung I would follow that ball right from the pitcher, over the plate, over (sometimes under) the bat and then right into the catcher's glove.  I sucked at hitting.  It was also a manager pitch game.  My manager struck me out every damn time.

Because I didn't seem to give a shit about the game, I was given the position catcher.  I would often miss the catch behind the plate.  Then I'd lumber my ass to a standing position looking for the damn ball through a sweat-encrusted catcher's mitt.  I'd find it and slowly walk over to it, pick it up, lunge it toward the mound, watch it go halfway to first and then crouch back down for the next hellish moment after the next pitch.

Fuck Central.
