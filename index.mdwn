Hello!  My name is David Johnson.  I like to do stuff like be [on the radio](http://www.wcbn.org/) and [go to work](http://www.perficient.com/) and [[listen to music|music]].  

The information here is sparse.  I am still working out the learning of the ikiwiki.

You may have come here looking for the [[Funk Radio Show|radiodavidj]] K and I did for our anniversary.  

My next time on the radio is Monday, March 23rd, from 6 to 9 am where I will be subbing for DWB's Slipstream Radio Show.

I am working out the deets on going to [Self Conference](http://www.selfconference.org/).

Things I want to do here:

* Exploit the last.fm API to display my listened to tracks.
* Apply some more CSS.  (not very specific, eh?)

I have some goals.  Mostly about learning.

<p>I most recently listened to <a href="" id="lastfmurl"><span id="lastfmname">nothing</span></a> by <span id="lastfmartist">nobody</span> from the album <span id="lastfmalbum">not known</span>.</p>
