Hello!  My name is David Johnson.  I like to do stuff like be [on the radio](http://www.wcbn.org/) and [go to work](http://www.perficient.com/) and [[listen to music|music]].  

The information here is sparse.  I am still working out the learning of the ikiwiki.

You may have come here looking for the [[Funk Radio Show|radiodavidj]] H and I did recently.

I will be on the air Thursday nights from 8 to 10 all summer long on [WCBN](http://www.wcbn.org/schedule/).

I am working out the deets on going to [Self Conference](http://www.selfconference.org/).

Things I want to do here:

* Exploit the last.fm API to display my listened to tracks.
* Apply some more CSS.  (not very specific, eh?)

I have some goals.  Mostly about learning.
